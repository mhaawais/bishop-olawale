                  Bishop Olawale Olaofe is more than a preacher ‚Äî he is a voice
                  of spiritual fire in our generation. A former oil company
                  executive turned presiding bishop, he leads{" "}

                  <em>‚ÄúCome and join Me in My harvest...‚Äù</em> (Matthew
                  9:35-37). His response changed everything ‚Äî he stepped down
                  from his corporate role and stepped fully into his Kingdom
                  assignment.
